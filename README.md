Hello Everyone! I will be adding some code to this section so that I can learn more about GitHub! I am really excited to be working with everyone on this team.

public class javaex{
	
public static void main(String args[])
{
	System.out.println("  ");
	System.out.println("This is just a space! This is the start of something new!");
	System.out.println("Hello Everyone!");
	
	
}
}
